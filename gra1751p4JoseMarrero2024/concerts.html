						<h3>$120.00</h3>
						<p>Ticket sales are limited to 6 per household, per show for the presale and 8 per household, per show for the general on sale (a maximum of 8 tickets per household can be booked per show). Only tickets purchased through approved agents are valid. The venue reserves the right to refuse admission. Ticket resale is permitted at no more than the price you paid (face value + booking fees). Please only use the official resale partner www.twickets.live . Selling tickets through unauthorised resale platforms will breach our TCs and those tickets may be cancelled. This ticket is a personal, revocable license and, at all times, remains the property of the Promoters. This ticket must be surrendered to the Promoters upon request. This ticket is sold on behalf of the Promoters to the Consumer. Business or traders are specifically prohibited from purchasing for this event. Any who do so will have their tickets cancelled. All ticket sales data will be manually forensically examined and any evidence of the use of aggressive software, multiple identities or any other unlawful practice will be passed to National Trading Standards E-crime team and Police. This may lead to tickets being cancelled.</p>
