					<h2>H.E.R. - The Glass (Audio) ft. Foo Fighters</h2>
					  <p>Lyrics: I had a vision of you And just like that I was left to live without it I found a version of love And just like that I was left to live without it Waiting for this storm to pass Waiting on this side of the glass But I see my reflection in you You see your reflection in me How could it be? How could it be? There is something between us Between me and you There is something between us I see right through I had a version of home And just like that I was left to live without it I had a person I loved And just like that I was left to live without him Waiting for this storm to pass Waiting on this side of the glass But I see my reflection in you You see your reflection in me How can it be? How can it be? There is something between us Between me and you There is something between us I see right through I had a vision of you And just like that I was left to live without it Waiting on this side of the glass</p>

					<h2>Foo Fighters - Under You (From 'Preparing Music For Concerts')</h2>
					  <p>Lyrics: I woke up and walked a million miles today I’ve been looking up and down for you All this time it still feels just like yesterday  That I walked a million miles with you Over it Think I’m getting over it But, there’s no getting over it There are times that I need someone There are times I feel like no one Sometimes I just don’t know what to do  There are days I can’t remember There are days that last forever Someday I’ll come out from under you Out from under you Someone said I’ll never see your face again Part of me just can’t believe it’s true Pictures of us sharing songs and cigarettes This is how I’ll always picture you Over it Think I’m getting over it There’s no getting over It There are times that I need someone There are times I feel like no one Sometimes I just don’t know what to do There are days I can’t remember There are days that last forever Someday I’ll come out from under you Out from under you There are times I think it’s over There are times I can’t recover Sometimes I just don’t know what to do There are days I can’t remember There are days that last forever Someday I’ll come out from under you Out from under you</p>
